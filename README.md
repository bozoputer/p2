#Project 2 - PHP Basics


##Description
This project is a password generator created for the Harvard Extension School course, Dynamic Web Applications (CSCI E-15). 

###Project goal:

+ The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the basics of PHP..

###Task
+ Create an [xkcd style](http://xkcd.com/936/) password generator.
+ Form inputs to specify:
	- How many words to use.
	- Whether to include a number.
    - Whether to include a special symbol (for example, @).
+ Basic server-side validation (for example, what happens if the user enters a string instead of a number to indicate number of words?). You can do client-side validation as well, but it is not a substitute for server-side validation.
